# Darkmatter Skirts

I didn't expect this project to become so desired, given the large (expensive) screen. But here we are.

The enthusiasm behind these skirts intended for the Doom Voron V2 led me to add support for 250 and 350 specs, in addition to my desired 300 spec. The Waveshare 11.9" screen (DSI recommended) offers a large display and easy interaction with [KlipperScreen](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This design also only supports the typical filtered mains inlet and separate rocker switch for now.
